create table personal_info(name varchar(30),age number(100),email varchar(30),blood_group varchar(3))



create table myinfo(name varchar(20),age number(3),phone_number number(11),email varchar(15),blood_group varchar(3) )





to check tables structure ::

Describe tablename;



how to insert data: insert into myinfo values('Adnan',24,01681774179,'talukderadnan','O+')



how to check uur inserted values : select * from myinfo;



create a table for student_info:

create table student24_info(name varchar(25),id number (14),department varchar(5),semester number(2),CGPA number(6,2))

insert into student24_info values('Adnan',14-27859-3,'CSE',1,3.5)

...............................

to make an information unique:(primary key)

create table ST(name varchar(25),id number (14) primary key,department varchar(5),semester number(2),CGPA number(6,2))

                                                                              OR

create table ST(name varchar(25),id number (14), primary key(id),department varchar(5),semester number(2),CGPA number(6,2))

insert into ST values('Adnan',14278593,'cse',3,3.55)

insert into ST values('rahman',14289365,'cse',2,2.45)

insert into ST values('tanvir',14278663,'BBA',3,2.55)

insert into ST values('Adnassn',14278593,'cse',3,3.65)

select * from ST;

(here id has been used as unique detector so same id number cant be paste twice.)

.....................

how to delete data :

Delete from tablename  where columname=values

for eg.

Delete from stud_info where id=5

................

how to update:

update  tablename set columname where columname=values

for eg:

update stud_info set cgpa=3.55 where id=3 







update and delete as whole code from begining:



create table ST(name varchar(25),id number (14) primary key,department varchar(5),semester number(2),CGPA number(6,2))

insert into ST values('Adnan',14278593,'cse',3,3.55)

insert into ST values('rahman',14289365,'cse',2,2.45)

insert into ST values('tanvir',14278663,'BBA',3,2.55)

insert into ST values('Adnassn',14278596,'cse',3,3.65)

select * from ST;

delete from ST where id=14278596;

update ST set cgpa=4.2 where id=14278593

how to search data from an automated data table :

select * from emp

select empno,sal*12 from emp(can multiply for finding its multiple)

if anyone want he can replace the collum name by the following wasys:



select empno,sal*12"annual sal" from emp

                 OR

select empno,sal*12 as anuual_sal from emp



to find someones specified information follow this step:



select empno,ename,sal*12 as anuual_sal from emp where ename='BLAKE'



FEW SIGNS:

<> (not equal to)

AND ,OR ,IN, BETWEEN,>,<



datas can be found by comparing or putting conditions like FOR EG.



select * from emp where sal>2000

select empno,ename,job from emp where sal>2000



how to put two conditions:

select empno,ename,job,sal from emp where sal>2000 and job='MANAGER'



to use multiple condition:



select * from emp where job in('MANAGER','ANALYST')

            OR

select * from emp where job in('MANAGER','ANALYST','SALESMAN')

 



HOW TO FIND VALUES BETWEEN ANY GIVEN BOUNDARY:

 FOR EG.

select *from emp where sal between 2000 and 3000

 '''''''''''''''''''''

for numbers:

to find something by ascending order:

select * from emp where job='MANAGER' order by sal asc 



to find something by descending order:

select * from emp where job='MANAGER' order by sal desc



FOR ALPHABETS:

to find something by ascending order:

select * from emp where job='MANAGER' order by ename asc



to find something by descending order:

select * from emp where job='MANAGER' order by ename desc
